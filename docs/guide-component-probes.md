# Laptop component probes

Use the real queue, API and command runner with fake GPU inventory. Bare
`myce dev` is a long-running server. The bounded standalone test starts an exact
binary with isolated HOME/state, authenticates, verifies one command's file
effect and exact release, drains through queue maintenance, then joins the child
and confirms its listener closed:

```sh
go build -o .reports/myce ./cmd/myce
MYCE_DEV_SMOKE_BINARY="$PWD/.reports/myce" go test -race -count=3 ./cmd/myce -run '^TestDevStandaloneSmoke$'
```

`TestMaintenance*` covers two-device admission/Started, drain versus stop,
restart/rejoin, stale or missing reports, unknown native/engine/Docker custody,
pending creates, cancellation and memory policy/debt. Queue decisions use injected
time. `TestDevProbeQueueRestart` exercises actual API outage, SQLite reopen,
lost-response keyed replay and cancellation without duplicate command effects.
`TestDevProbeRebootResume` restarts the real dev queue/workers with durable disabled
policy and requires fresh reports before quiescence. Process restart models the
protocol boundary; it does not claim an actual machine reboot.

Keep Docker stop/recovery/result, cancellation/all-attempt release, engine and
model recovery, RAM/cgroup/sidecar limits, files, installer rollback/GPU environment
and privacy suites. There are no local CAS, root-child or rest verdict matrices.
Record command exits; the [native test plan](production-test-plan.md) separately
requires authorized daemon, memory, manager, GPU and reboot evidence.
